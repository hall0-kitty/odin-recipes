        To cook rice you will need to main ingredients </p>
<ul>
    <li>Medium grain white rice</li>
    <li>Filtered water </li>
</ul>
<p>Measure out howerver much rice you'd like. However keep in mind that the rice will double in volume. 
    Pour in the filtered water till the rice is covered.
    With clean hands agitate the rice and water pour out the cloudy water and repeat two more times.
     This process is called "washing" and helps get rid of excess starch in the rice.  
</p>
<p>Once the rice has been "washed" we will fill the pot with water. How much?
    To make sure we've added enough water we will stick our index finger in the water. 
    If the water comes up to the first knuckle we know that we've added enough.  
</p>
<p>Place the pot over the stove and bring the heat up to medium low.
    Once bubbles begin to form, bring the heat up to a medium high.
    The cooking shouldn't take more than 20 min so keep an eye on the rice.
    Once there are no more bubbles remove the lid fluff the rice and let sit for about 5 min.
    this will allow any excess water to escape and the rice to have a firm fluffy texture.
